MDX (Markdown eXtended) is a popular syntax that allows you to seamlessly use JSX (React components) within Markdown documents. Here's a quick MDX cheatsheet:

### Headers

```md
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

### Emphasis

```md
*italic*
**bold**
***bold and italic***
```

### Lists

#### Unordered List

```md
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem A
  - Subitem B
```
#### Ordered List

```md
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   1. Subitem A
   2. Subitem B
```

### Links

```md
[Link text](https://www.example.com)
```

### Images

```md
![Alt text](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)
```

### Blockquotes

```md
> This is a blockquote.
```

### Code

Inline code: 
```
code
```

Code block:

```javascript
const code = "Hello, World!";
console.log(code);
```

### Horizontal Line

```md
---
```

### Tables

```md
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| ---------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
```

### Embedding JSX/React Components

```md
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

<MyComponent prop1="value1" prop2="value2" />
```

### Components

In MDX, you can use React components directly. If you have a React component called ***MyComponent***, you can include it in your MDX file like this:

```jsx
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

<MyComponent />
```

### Frontmatter

MDX often supports frontmatter at the beginning of a file to add metadata. For example:

```yaml

This is a basic MDX cheatsheet, and there are more advanced features and configurations depending on the specific tools and frameworks you're using. Always refer to the documentation of the tools you are working with for more details.
